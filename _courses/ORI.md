Computational Intelligence Fundamentals course is given on the sixth semester of undergraduate studies.

### Goal 

Students learn about the basic principles and techniques of "classical" artificial intelligence and soft computing. 

### Outcome 

Identification, structure and techniques of solving problems which require intelligence.

### Content 

Main topics of the course:

Concepts, aims, approaches, environment and areas of AI application. Logical programming: propositional and first order logic; Prolog programming language. Search: blind and heuristic search, genetic algorithms. Problem solving in uncertainty conditions: probabilistic approach, fuzzy approach. Fundamentals of machine learning, types of algorithms, approaches, artificial neural networks. Knowledge based systems. Intelligent software agents: definition, types, architecture, technologies. Applications of AI.
