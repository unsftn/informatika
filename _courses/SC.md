The Soft Computing course is given on the seventh semester of undergraduate studies.

### Goal 

Students will learn about concepts, techniques and selected examples of application of soft computing.

### Outcome 

The acquired knowledge is the basis for solving complex problems which require intelligence and cannot be solved using conventional mathematical approach.

### Content 

Main topics of the course:

Evolutionary computing: genetic algorithms, genetic programming, multiple intelligence, evolutionary strategies. Neural computing: neural networks. Machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning. Fuzzy systems: fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic. Probabilistic reasoning: belief propagation, chaos theory.
