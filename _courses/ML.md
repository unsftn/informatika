The Machine Learning course is given on the eighth semester of undergraduate studies.

### Goal 

Introduce students to the basic concepts, elements, and techniques of Machine Learning. 

### Outcome 

By the end of the course, the student can:

* Define the following basic machine learning problems: Regression, Classification, Clustering,  Dimensionality Reduction.
* Explain the main differences between these problems.
* Describe and implement important models and algorithms for each of these problems.
* Apply them to real-world problems.
* Compare their performances.
* Derive the theory behind ML methods taught in the course.
