The Machine Learning course is given on the eighth semester of undergraduate studies.

### Goal 

Introduce students to the basic concepts, elements, and techniques of Machine Learning. 

### Outcome 

By the end of the course, the student can:
* Define the following basic machine learning problems: Regression, Classification, Clustering,  Dimensionality Reduction.
* Explain the main differences between these problems.
• Describe and implement important models and algorithms for each of these problems.
• Apply them to real-world problems.
• Compare their performances.
* Derive the theory behind ML methods taught in the course.

### Content 

Main topics of the course:
1. Supervised Learning
  * Linear Regression
  * Regularization, Overfitting, and Model Selection
  * Non-parametric approach (Nearest Neighbor and Kernel Regression)
  * Maximum Likelihood method
  * Logistic Regression
  * Perceptron
