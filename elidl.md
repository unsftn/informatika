### About

ELIDL (E-learning Instructional Design Meta-Language) is a language for specifying generic and domain-neutral instructional design. We represent instructional design as rules for sequencing and selection of learning content in a course.  Three main goals have been set for ELIDL - to be generic, expressive and machine-readable. ELIDL is an XML-based language and can be considered a meta-language for IMS Learning Design (IMS LD) specification. An instructional strategy represented using ELIDL may be applied to any learning content resulting in a concrete IMS LD course shaped according to the specified strategy.

### Examples
